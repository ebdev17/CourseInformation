## Instructor ##

My name is Ethan Brown. I'm a Weber State Alumni and a Site Reliability Engineer at Adobe.
I consider myself more of a python developer than C# but I enjoy working with it.

The book is optional but it might be a useful reference. I will be using it to prepare
class lectures.

We will be using Visual Studio 2015+ and git. You may use the free community edition.
We will cover how to download it as well as git in class.

## Course Fee ##

Course fees for the Computer Science major are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment
maintenance and replacement including desktop and server computer systems and software;
consumable materials and supplies; and support for lab aides, student tutors, and online
instructional resources.

## Assignments ##

The course will be broken up into 2 parts. The first part will consist of smaller
assignments that will be focused on learning general concepts of C# and Windows Applications
The second part will be focused on a final group project.

* Assignments will be given with plenty of time to complete
* I will allow time in class to work
* They will require time outside of class especially as they increase in scope and difficulty
* Late assignments will be given a 10%
*penalty
* Anything turned in over a week late will be given a 50%
*penalty
* You will use git to turn your code
* If you don't know git, don't panic! We will discuss how to use git in class and I will show you what you need know

## Asking Questions ##

Don't hesitate to ask questions. In this industry you have to be inquisitive, no matter how
"stupid" you think it is. The only thing that is stupid is making assumptions. Always clarify
and ask. There are 3 resources for asking questions.

1. In Class
2. Canvas Discussion Boards
3. direct email to me (only use this if it is a personal matter or urgent)

## Students With Disabilities ##

Any student requiring accommodations or services due to a disability must contact Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) in room 181 of the Student Services Center. SSD can also
arrange to provide course materials (including this syllabus) in alternative formats if necessary.
